2. The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.

3. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.

4. If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.

### Examples of low quailty contributions

+ Pull requests that are automated e.g. scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace / fix typos / optimize images.

+ Pull requests that are disruptive e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a pull request.

+ Pull requests that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.

+ Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your pull request count for October.

+ Last but not least, one pull request to fix a typo is fine, but 5 pull requests to remove a stray whitespace is not.
